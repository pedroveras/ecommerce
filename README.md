This is a microservice architecture example for a ecommerce that sells Geek Shirts.
The architecture and the services are still under development, but I intend to use the stack below.   

## Stack

 - SpringBoot - Application framework
 - Maven - Build
 - Consul - Service Registration and Discovery 
 - Zuul - API Gateway
 - Vault - Secrets storage
 - Docker - Containerization platform
 - Kakfa - Microservices messaging
 - Zookeeper - Centralized server (for Kafka)
 - Swagger - API documentation
 - Logstash - Log Collector
 - Elasticsearch - Log Indexer
 - Java 8
 - MongoDB
 - Redis
 - MySQL
